Hi, I'm Ryan.

I'm a Junior Computer Science and Statistics concentrator at Harvard. I love all things programming, especially those involved with data analysis and visualization. Outside of intellectual pursuits I am interested in ultimate frisbee, basketball and hiking.

This is my personal website to showcase my projects and express my thoughts. I also plan to [teach](/../posts/docendo-discimus.html) new techniques and technologies that I learn. You can also find me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ryan.kerr.904) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=356199467).
