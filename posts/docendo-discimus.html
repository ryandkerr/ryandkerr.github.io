<p>My dad has this saying about learning:</p>
<p><em>"The worst way to learn is to be taught<br>
The next best way is to teach yourself<br>
The best way to learn, is to teach"</em></p>
<p>He's been saying this to me ever since I was a little kid, and when I first heard it I paid no attention. I was young and he was my father, and the default response for any kind of wise adage was always "yeah right, dad."</p>
<p>But as time passes I've come to understand more and more the meaning behind the words. I've since learned the Latin phrase <strong><em>Docendo discimus</em></strong> and have adopted the phrase as somewhat of a personal motto. It translates to "by teaching, we learn" and speaks to the truth of my father's saying.</p>
<p>My dad may not have been entirely correct, but his words certainly point out the value of teaching. There is much to be learned by teaching. When I teach someone something new---be it a programming concept, help on a homework problem or a new technique in ultimate frisbee---I am forced to think critically about what really matters. Why should they do it this way? Is this really the most efficient technique? How do I identify similar situations in the future? Additionally I have to be able to think about and answer any questions that the other person may have, which is valuable because it inevitable leads me to think about things I had never even considered. Too often someone will ask me a question and I will know the answer, but will not be able to explain why or how. It is in those moments where teaching forces you to dig deep and truly learn.</p>
<p>This is what I hope to achieve with this blog, and with my projects in the future. Be it with blog posts, guides or data visualizations, I want readers to be able to learn something. Maybe I'll learn a thing or two along the way.</p>
