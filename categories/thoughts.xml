&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The worst way to learn is to be taught&lt;br&gt;
The next best way is to teach yourself&lt;br&gt;
The best way to learn, is to teach"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's been saying this to me ever since I was a little kid, and when I first heard it I paid no attention. I was young and he was my father, and the default response for any kind of wise adage was always "yeah right, dad."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as time passes I've come to understand more and more the meaning behind the words. I've since learned the Latin phrase &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Docendo discimus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and have adopted the phrase as somewhat of a personal motto. It translates to "by teaching, we learn" and speaks to the truth of my father's saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad may not have been entirely correct, but his words certainly point out the value of teaching. There is much to be learned by teaching. When I teach someone something new--be it a programming concept, help on a homework problem or a new technique in ultimate frisbee--I am forced to think critically about what really matters. Why should they do it this way? Is this really the most efficient technique? How do I identify similar situations in the future? Additionally I have to be able to think about and answer any questions that the other person may have, which is valuable because it inevitable leads me to think about things I had never even considered. Too often someone will ask me a question and I will know the answer, but will not be able to explain why or how. It is in those moments where teaching forces you to dig deep and truly learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I hope to achieve with this blog, and with my projects in the future. Be it with blog posts, guides or data visualizations, I want readers to be able to learn something. Maybe I'll learn a thing or two along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dd&lt;/em&gt;,
Ryan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>thoughts</category><guid>https://ryandkerr.github.io/posts/docendo-discimus.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2015 03:24:45 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
