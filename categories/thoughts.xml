&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The worst way to learn is to be taught&lt;br&gt;
The next best way is to teach yourself&lt;br&gt;
The best way to learn, is to teach"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's been saying this to me ever since I was a little kid, and when I first 
heard it I paid no attention. I was young and he was my father, and the default 
response for any kind of wise adage was always "yeah right, dad."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as time passes I've come to understand more and more the meaning behind the 
words. I've since learned the Latin phrase &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Docendo discimus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and have 
adopted the phrase as somewhat of a personal motto. It translates to "by 
teaching, we learn" and speaks to the truth of my father's saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad may not have been entirely correct, but his words certainly point out the
value of teaching. There is much to be learned by teaching. When I teach 
someone something new—be it a programming concept, help on a homework problem 
or a new technique in ultimate frisbee—I am forced to think critically about 
what really matters. Why should they do it this way? Is this really the most 
efficient technique? How do I identify similar situations in the future? 
Additionally I have to be able to think about and answer any questions that the
other person may have, which is valuable because it inevitable leads me to 
think about things I had never even considered. Too often someone will ask me a
question and I will know the answer, but will not be able to explain why or how.
It is in those moments where teaching forces you to dig deep and truly learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I hope to achieve with this blog, and with my projects in the 
future. Be it with blog posts, guides or data visualizations, I want readers to 
be able to learn something. Maybe I'll learn a thing or two along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dd&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
